= moat: Brain-dead simple password storage. Improved.

  Moat is "Heavily inspired" (ripped off completely) from password,

  Moat improves password by removing the ActiveSupport requirement,
    generating cleaner alphanumeric passwords, and hiding itself in a moatfile.
    Everything else should be exactly the same.

  Long story short, it's password. Just faster, more stable, and should generate
    passwords that even your bank will treat as valid. Though you might not want to use it there.

== DESCRIPTION:

moat is a simple command-line tool to store your INESSENTIAL passwords.

All passwords stored with moat are stored as plain text in a hidden file called
".moatfile" in your home directory.

If you store vitally essential personal information using moat, you are a
dumb motherfucker. (Or, at least, much braver than smart.)

== CODE EXAMPLES:

  moat -g twitter
  moat --get twitter

Prints your Twitter username and password to the terminal.

  moat -a

Prints every known username/password combo to the terminal.

  moat -s twitter wilbur s3cr3t
  moat --set twitter wilbur s3cr3t

Sets your moat entry for "twitter" to username "wilbur" and password "s3cr3t".

  moat -G twitter wilbur
  moat --generating_set twitter wilbur

Sets your moat entry for "twitter" to username "wilbur" and a 10-digit
autogenerated password, and prints the new username/password combo.

  moat -l 23 -G twitter wilbur
  moat --length 23 --generating_set twitter wilbur

Sets your moat entry for "twitter" to username "wilbur" and a 23-digit
autogenerated password, and prints the new username/password combo.
